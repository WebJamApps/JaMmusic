    Maria started her singing career at the age of 4 when she performed at the JaMar Rec
    Center in St. Petersburg, Florida. Maria continued adding to her musical repertoire
    by learning piano, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, bassoon, and marching tenors.
    She earned a minor in voice at Roanoke College and did a variety of chorus, musical theatre,
    and solo performances while teaching in the Roanoke County Schools. Although classically
    trained, Maria loves singing rock and Christian music with Josh. She is currently playing bass
    guitar and plays accordian. Josh is the most wonderful husband and is the driving
    force for the couple; Maria is a fabulous wife and is the organization behind the duo.
